## Personal Summary
I graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a 2:1 Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, with strong technical skills and consistent, self-motivated work ethic. During my time at university I was first introduced to both Java and Python software development, primarily in the capacity of backend, I am looking to build on the programming, problem solving and organisational skills I have developed, and have been teaching myself. I am eager to apply them to real world applications in an organisation that will enable me to progress further while delivering to deadlines in a team and/or autonomous environment.
